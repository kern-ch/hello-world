# hello-world
My first foray into the GitHub world 
I'm a Mom of four young children leading a crazy life of playdates, snack time, clean up, and tickle time all while findind sanity in code! I've entered this world to nurture my brain while nurturing my children. Striving to strike a balance between Motherhood and Entrepreneurship.
